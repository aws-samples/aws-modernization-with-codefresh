# Introduction

Welcome to the AWS Modernization Workshop with GitOps and Codefresh.

Deploying new versions of your application with a high degree of confidence
is a desirable goal as getting features reliably to production is one
of the most important characteristics of fast moving organizations.

In a cloud environment, problematic deployment methods can quickly become the bottleneck, as having the capability to instantly spin up new infrastructure
doesn't always mean that your application developers can take advantage
of the new infrastructure in the most optimal way.

In this workshop you will learn about deployments in a cloud environment
and more specifically on Amazon Elastic Computing Cloud (EC2) Amazon Elastic Kubernetes service (EKS)

We will guide you through the following steps

* Creating a basic packaging pipeline that creates a container from your application source code
* Adding unit tests and security checks in the basic pipeline to ensure quality 
and security of the container
* Deploying an application to EC2
* Setting up Continuous Delivery to Kubernetes
* Installing a GitOps agent to your cluster
* Performing releases by Git actions
* Monitoring deployments, viewing release history and rolling back to previous versions.


Expected Duration:

 * 2-3 Hours

Target Audience:

* Devops Engineers
* Cloud Architects
* Release managers
* Service engineers
* Developers
* Platform engineers

Some experience/knowledge with AWS and Kubernetes/containers is helpful but the workshop will provide instructions to run through the workshop with no issues and if you are attending one of our live workshop sessions there will be folks to help assist with issues that come up.
